# F1 Insight

> Live app: [https://f1-insight.com](https://f1-insight.com)

A visual analytics web application, where you can see race results, driver results, team results, and driver/teams standings of the current Formula 1 season. By showing the results of all races using graphs, F1 Insight makes it easy to find trends in the data, something that would be very tedious and non-trivial otherwise by inspecting isolated race results.
